    <h2>What / why / how</h2>

    <p>
      The Web is our only hope for a platform that provides permissionless user
      agency. This project is about scratching that itch, building a Web based
      user agent that can play new tricks. Our mascot is a beaver because they
      are fantastic animals that heal their environment; read
      <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/we-need-to-rewild-the-internet/"
        >this essay</a
      >
      for a good introduction, and come with us rewild your web!
    </p>

    <p>
      We build on <a href="https://servo.org">Servo</a> because despite a new
      wave of browsers being built, they mostly go with forking blink, and
      that's not how we will diversify the Web. Also this is a very fun project
      to contribute to!
    </p>

    <p>
      The end goal is to have a suite of Web user agents. Running on top of an
      existing OS is a temporary stop-gap, because being a second class citizen
      on someone else's platform is a dead end.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will create new personal computing environments for mobile, desktop,
      media players, etc. We have a long road ahead, but we're not in a hurry.
    </p>
